Microcopy voice & guidance

Voice:

- Tone: concise, helpful, collaborative.
- Person: second person (you), or neutral when system-level.
- Length: short sentences, 1–2 lines for CTAs and helper text.
- Action-first: lead with the user action, then context.

Examples:

- CTA primary: "Create sprint"
- CTA destructive: "Delete sprint"
- Empty state: "No issues yet — create your first issue to get started."
- Helper: "Assign an owner to this issue to track responsibility."

Status/priority label guidance:

- Keep labels short (one word preferred), uppercase optional.
- Place status icons left of label, with an accessible text label.
- Use color as an affordance, not the only cue — always include icon + text.
